Working In Teams Project.

First Get the Account to Access the Team instance, If you dont get your v- Account We can use our own email address to get the o365 Tenant

https://www.office.com/

Go here and signup After that  go to Admin => Add Users add  one get the tenant

Then  Open https://teams.microsoft.com

GO to More Apps and search for the AppStudio.
App Studio is the place to  Create/ Update/ Delete/ Deploy our  Applications


On Creating the new application, On Last step if you download it, we have The Manifest file and 2 more images will gets download.

We can modify the Manifest as per the requirement and upload to the teams app again.

Manifest wont accept local paths so our application needs be running on the server, i.e our application needs to deploy on some server.

ngrok will helps to deploy our appllication into specific port

For that, goto https://ngrok.com/ and signup with your email and download the ngrok application into local and run the application in Administrator mode.

Once it ran use ngrok http -portNumber

Then You will get the ngrok 2 urls which points to http and https
just copy the https urls and paste in Manifest for contentUrl and Website Url values

Now Zip all files 2 images and Manifest then Goto teams Under More Apps there is an option called uploade a custom app on click it will ask for zipped folder.
Just Give our zipped folder and install the app and open it works as expected

==========================================================================================================================================

We can also Integrate our application into teams. for that Just need to run the npm server of our application by going to command prompt
goto the application where you have 
Ex:C:\Windows\users>cd C:\MyTeamsApp
C:\MyTeamsApp>npm install
C:\MyTeamsApp>npm start

It will tell you on which port it is running on

We just need to notedown that port and run the ngrock with that port and replace https url of ngrock in Manifest file
