Setup Instructions to Work with App Studio UI

First Get the Account to Access the Team instance, If you dont get your v- Account We can use our own email address to get the o365 Tenant

https://www.office.com/

Go here and signup After that  go to Admin => Add Users add  one get the tenant. Make sure teams access is selected

Then  Open https://teams.microsoft.com

In Teams application, Go to More Apps and search for the AppStudio.
App Studio is the place to  Create/ Update/ Delete/ Deploy our  Application

On Creating the new application, On Final step go to "Test and Distribute" option where you can intall, submit and download the app.
if you download it, we have The Manifest file and 2 more images will gets download. 

We can modify the Manifest as per the requirement and upload to the teams app again to reflect the changes.

Manifest wont accept local paths so our application needs be running on the server, i.e our application needs to deploy on some server.

ngrok will helps to deploy our appllication into specific port

For that, goto https://ngrok.com/ and signup with your email and download the ngrok application into local and run the application in Administrator mode.

Once it ran use ngrok http -portNumber, This will run the application in the provided portNumber

Then You will get the ngrok 2 urls which points to http and https
just copy the https urls and paste in Manifest for contentUrl and Website Url values

Now Zip all files 2 images and Manifest then Goto teams Under More Apps there is an option called uploade a custom app on click it will ask for zipped folder.
Just Give our zipped folder and install the app and open it works as expected

==========================================================================================================================================
Integrate our application into teams:

make sure npm server is running if not goto the path where your application is exist
Ex:C:\Windows\users>cd C:\MyTeamsApp
C:\MyTeamsApp>npm install
C:\MyTeamsApp>npm start

It will tell you on which port it is running on

We just need to notedown that port and run the ngrock with that port and replace https url of ngrock in Manifest file

like: ngrok http 3333

========================================================================================================================================

Running Production In local:

Go to the root folder, make sure npm, yarn and concurrently is installed then execute below commands in commandprompt
1) npm run bootstrap // this will get all the dependencies
2) npm run dev // this will build the application and run the npm server

This will open the manifest-editor-st dont close it, it should be open to run the npm server.
